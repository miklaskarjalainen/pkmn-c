# PKMN-C
Is a battle library for pokemon like games. The idea is to completely recreate pokemon's battle system in C.

## Caution!
This is a very much WIP project and is not functional in most cases.

## Building
Building requires pokemon.txt and moves.txt from pokemon essentials (this repository doesn't contain data of any pokemon). After acquiring those use the parse scripts from the /scripts/ directory.
